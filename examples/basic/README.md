# Basic Kafka Example

This example demonstrates how to use the Kafka API to produce and consume messages, providing config via a properties file.

This example does not use Spring. Although I can't recommend this barebones approach, it is useful to understand which components are Spring, and which parts are Apache Kafka.

```shell
mvn clean compile exec:java
```
